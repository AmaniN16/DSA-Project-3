Before you can begin here is some background information to help use the engine:
1. While it does not matter which letters are capitalized, spelling and spacing can affect searching
2. Not every possible job you can think of is currently in our database. Therefore, we will list all the jobs currently available
3. You will be asked at the start which data structure you would like to use: hash table or map
4. When searching you will be asked to provide input for each filter. If you don't care about that specific filter click enter without typing anything (except for job name)
The list of jobs is provided within the program.
